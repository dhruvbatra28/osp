🖥️ OS Process Scheduling Simulator

This project is a CPU Process Scheduling Simulator that demonstrates how different scheduling algorithms work in an Operating System. Process scheduling is one of the most crucial tasks of an OS to ensure efficient CPU utilization, reduced waiting time, and fair process execution.

🚀 Features

The simulator supports the following scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS) → Executes processes in the order they arrive.

Shortest Job First (SJF) → Picks the process with the shortest burst time first.

Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF) → Preemptive version of SJF, selects the process with the least remaining time.

Round Robin (RR) → Allocates a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic manner.

📊 What You Can Do

Add processes with custom burst time and arrival time.

Visualize how each algorithm schedules processes.

Compare waiting time, turnaround time, throughput, and CPU utilization across algorithms.

Find out which scheduling technique gives the best efficiency for your workload.

🎯 Purpose

This project helps in understanding and comparing scheduling strategies in Operating Systems. It is a great learning tool for students and enthusiasts to visualize how processes are managed inside a CPU.
